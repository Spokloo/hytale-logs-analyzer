# Hytale-Logs-Analyzer

![Github Downloads](https://img.shields.io/github/downloads/Spokloo/hytale-logs-analyzer/total?style=flat-square)

A tool to analyze game logs generated by Hytale to calculate your total playtime. This is done to calculate the total playtime based on the logs. You can create graphs from the playtime and also export it as a csv file. [Download it here](https://github.com/Spokloo/hytale-logs-analyzer/releases/latest)

### There are 3 modes:

1. Automatic (default)
2. Enter path(s)
3. Enter glob
---
1. Automatic mode trys to detect your logs in the normal Hytale folder 
`C:/Users/USER/AppData/Roaming/Hytale/UserData`

2. Path mode allows you can enter your own file paths
Separate multiple paths with pipes (vertical bar: | ).

3. In glob mode, you can use a glob pattern to select multiple folders within a directory.
The glob will match your specified path as well as all subdirectory paths that exist and match the pattern.
To include multiple glob patterns, separate them with pipes |
Ensure that file paths do not overlap when using multiple patterns. You can read more about globs [here](https://pymotw.com/3/glob/).
Globs can take a bit to load if your selection is large.\
**Example**: `C:/Users/USER/AppData/Roaming/.*/**`) will find all logs folders in all folders that start with . in Roaming.

## Results
You can export the results into 2 ways
- A graph with hours per month
- A csv file with hours per session

## False positives
If you use the .exe file you might get a false positive with virus programs. I used pyinstaller to create a .exe from the .pyw file. I used this command to build the .exe:

```
pyinstaller --clean --icon=icon.ico --onefile --splash=splash.png hytale_logs_analyzer.pyw
```

There is also a [Makefile](./Makefile) included so you can just use that to build your own .exe if you don't trust mine but you have to install [pyinstaller](https://pypi.org/project/pyinstaller/) with `pip install --user pyinstaller`.

This next part is only for those who use the .pyw version

---

At least python 3.6 is required for this program to work it might work on python 3.5, but I have not tested that.

(I now added python 3.7 and 3.8 support)

It also seems to work fine with python 3.10.

This program uses matplotlib pyplot to create graphs. If you do not have matplotlib installed please install it by entering the flowing command into the cmd:
`pip install --user matplotlib`

If that does not work try to reinstall python and make sure to click the install pip option.

The program will also detect if you do not have matplotlib installed, and it will ask you if you want to auto install.
This will basically run `os.system("pip install --user matplotlib")` this is the same as running `pip install --user matplotlib` in the cmd.

## Running on linux

The .exe version works through [wine](https://www.winehq.org/). It was tested on ubuntu 20 and it worked through wine. 

You can also just run run `python3 hytale_logs_analyzer.pyw`. The automatic mode might not detect your `Hytale` directory. You can manually specify the Hytale logs path if you have to. If you want to make graphs you need the matplotlib dependency. Install it using pip `python3 -m pip install matplotlib`
